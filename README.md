## Motivation
Automatic image caption generator is a widely used deep learning application that combines `convolutional neural network` and `recurrent neural network` to allow `computer vision` tasks being `described in written statement` and/or in `sound of text`.

The precision of a complex scene description requires a deeper representation of what's actually going on in the scene, the relation among various objects as manifested on the image and the translation of their relationships in one natural-sounding language. Many efforts of establishing such the automatic image camptioning generator combine current state-of-the-art techniques in both *computer vision (CV)* and *natural language processing (NLP)* to form a complete image description approach. We feed one image into this single jointly trained system, and a human readable sequence of words used to describe this image is produced, accordingly. Below shows you how this application can translate from images into words automatically and accurately.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->
* You have installed `Jupyter Notebooks` for offline analysis. There're two options to setup the Jupyter Notebooks locally: Docker container and Anaconda. You will need a computer with at least 4GB of RAM.
* Alternatively, you can run all tasks online via `Google Colab`. Google has released its own flavour of Jupyter called Colab, which has free GPUs!
* You have a `Windows/Linux/Mac` machine.

## Installing for Offline Instructions

To install Automatic Image Caption Generator, follow these steps:

Linux and macOS: Docker container option
```
Follow the [instructions](https://hub.docker.com/r/zimovnov/coursera-aml-docker) to install Docker container with all necessary software installed.
```

Windows: Anaconda option

```
<install_command>
```
